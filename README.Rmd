# Echarty

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This package is a thin R wrapper around Javascript library [Echarts.js](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) v.5. The focus is on simplicity and efficiency. The list parameters come straight from the [original documentation](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html). There are just a few extra commands. Users can build elaborate interactive charts in R and Shiny with minimal coding.

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of Echarty from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
``` r
install.packages("echarty")
```
-->

Until approved by [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org), you can install the development version

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("helgasoft/echarty")
```

## Example

``` r
library(echarty)

#  basic chart
cars %>% ec.init()

#  chart with plugins 3D and GL
e <- ec.init(load = c('3D','GL'))
e$x$opts$series[[1]] <- list(
 type = 'surface',
 data = ec.data(as.data.frame(as.table(volcano)), TRUE)
)
e 
```

There are plenty of code examples in the Help.  
Type **?ec.examples** in the Console, then copy/paste any example to see the result.  
  
Now you can start building [**beautiful charts**](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/index.html) (and [**more**](https://www.makeapie.com)) from R and Shiny!
