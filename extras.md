# echarty extras 💲

Utilities and small applications built on top of open-source library _echarty_. They accomplish very specific and uncommon tasks.
Considerable amount of time was spent in design, development and testing of these modules.  
<br>
They are fairly priced at **$30 each** and payable through [**Paypal**](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/helgasoft).  
Please include module description when ordering under "_What is this payment for ?_". Delivery and support by email.  
Future versions will be sent on demand (not automatically).

## Violin chart  
<br />  
Violin charts are similar to boxplot, but show the full distribution of the data. Supports single or grouped datasets.   
<details><summary>🔻 Parameters</summary>  

- <strong>df</strong> data.frame with X,Y values (required)
- <strong>cvalue</strong> name of values column (required)
- <strong>cname</strong> optional name of names(categories) column
- <strong>vertical</strong> boolean for vertical(default) or horizontal layout
- <strong>lineWidth</strong> width of the contour line, default 3
- <strong>wcoeff</strong> width coefficient for each violin, default is 0.45
- <strong>jitter</strong> value (>=0) of parameter _amount_ in jitter, default NULL(no jittered points)
- <strong>j.*</strong> optional jitter points parameters like j.symbolSize
- <strong>d.*</strong> optional density parameters like d.adjust,d.cut,etc. d.n default is 64
- <strong>m.*</strong> optional mean point parameters like m.symbol,m.symbolSize,etc. If missing, mean is not shown.
- <strong>...</strong> optional attributes for the violin contour series
- <strong>returns</strong> a named list of xAxis, yAxis and series. Series are: _custom_ for violin, optional _scatter_ for jitter and mean.

## Keyboard Input Support
<br />

Enter keyboard mode with _click_, exit with _Tab_  
Keys with functions implemented, more possible:  
- arrowLeft, arrowRight = highlight data points to left and right
- pageUp, pageDown = switch series
- +, - =  zoom chart in and out

## 3D regression planes
<br />

The familiar _quakes_ R dataset is visualized in 3D environment (lat,long,depth) over an area map with tectonic plate boundaries. 
User can show/hide 3D regression planes(s) built from selected 3D points.

## Morphing drilldown
<br />

The _mtcars_ R dataset presented with morphing drilldown. There are two levels of data:
- top level is an aggregate, like counts by type, or average by type
- lower level are the actual data rows

Morphing is achieved between two top levels, and between top and lower levels.
