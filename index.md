## Introduction

The goal of **echarty** is to provide a minimal interface between R and native ECharts [components](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html).
Use R data lists and a few _echarty_ commands to build a chart. There are utilities included to assist with data preparation (*ec.data*), Shiny with proxy (*ecs.\**) and formatting (*ec.clmn*).  
Have the **full functionality** of [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/index.html) in R with minimal overhead!   
<br/>  
<!-- 
Building complex charts as data structures is a powerful concept, also simple and easy to use.  As decribed in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.visinf.2018.04.011), library ECharts' foundation lays on the "*user-configurable declarative object* **option**". [Option](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html) is JSON-like data.

## Learn by example
Try [WebR Coder](test/coder.html) or the more complete R **Coder**:
```r
demo(coder, package='echarty')
```
See what you can do with echarty and **Shiny**
```r
demo(eshiny, package='echarty')
```
Have fun with **Translator Assistant**  - translate Javascript data to R! 
&nbsp; ECharts has lots of great [examples](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/)
. The goal is to facilitate translation of their JSON-like data (*option* object) to R lists.
```r
demo(js2r, package='echarty')
```
