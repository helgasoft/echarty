## Learn by example
Have fun with **echarty Translator Assistant**  - translate Javascript data to R !  
Javascript library Echarts has lots of great [examples](href="https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/)
. The goal is to facilitate the translation of their **data** to R, especially the *option* object. Option components represent the chart.  
Give it a go with the following R command
```r
echarty::ec.js2r()   # in version 0.1.1
```
